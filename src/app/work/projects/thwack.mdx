## Overview

THWACK represented a unique creative playground within the SolarWinds ecosystem, where I was empowered to push design boundaries and experiment with bold visual concepts. As the community platform's designer, I had the freedom to break away from traditional corporate design constraints while maintaining just enough connection to the parent brand to create a distinct yet related identity.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Creative Exploration**: Developed experimental design concepts that challenged traditional corporate aesthetics, introducing playful elements and bold visual treatments that set THWACK apart.
- **Community Engagement**: Created attention-grabbing visual content that resonated with the tech community, including gamification elements, badges, and interactive design components.
- **Brand Evolution**: Crafted a distinct visual voice for THWACK that lived adjacent to, but distinctly separate from, the main SolarWinds brand, allowing for more creative expression.
- **Campaign Innovation**: Designed unconventional marketing campaigns that incorporated elements of humor, pop culture, and technical creativity to engage the IT community.

## Technical Toolkit

- **Design Software**: Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) pushed to its creative limits
- **Digital Design**: Interactive elements, custom illustrations, and dynamic visual content
- **Brand Experimentation**: Creative interpretation and evolution of brand guidelines
- **Community Design**: Gamification elements, badge systems, and engagement-focused visuals

## Achievements

Successfully established THWACK as a creative outlier within the SolarWinds family, where design could be more experimental and playful. Created memorable campaigns and visual elements that increased community engagement and became talking points among users. Demonstrated how a sub-brand could maintain its connection to a corporate parent while expressing its own unique personality.

## Results

The creative freedom exercised in THWACK design work led to higher community engagement rates and stronger user connections. The platform became known for its distinctive visual style, setting it apart from typical corporate community sites while still maintaining its professional credibility. This approach proved that technical content could be presented in ways that were both informative and creatively engaging.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Brand Strategy**: Visual identity development and brand guideline creation
- **Performance Design**: Conversion-focused creative for digital marketing campaigns  
- **B2B Communications**: Complex data visualization and technical concept translation
- **Project Management**: End-to-end campaign execution from concept to delivery
- **Cross-functional Collaboration**: Working effectively with sales, marketing, and product teams
